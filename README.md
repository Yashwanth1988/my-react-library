# my-react-library
the basic set &amp; configuration for creating library ( not published )

Looks at the package json of 'react-seed' project for how to use
Since it is not publised to internet we tried using it local for testing purpose
  {
    "dependencies": {
      "react": "^16.8.1",
      "react-dom": "^16.8.1",
      "react-lib": "file:../../react-lib" /* this way - pointing to the
                                             library locally download from your host application (react-seed) */
    }
  }
